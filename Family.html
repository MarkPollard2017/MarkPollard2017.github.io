<p>My father was born and raised in Maine. He's lived in the pine tree state all his life. He is a professional welder and fabricator. My mother was born and raised in Rhode Island, but moved to Maine after graduating from high school. She works for a company called Gold Medal Bakery–located in Massachusetts–and is the regional sales representative for the state of Maine.</p>
<p align="left"; style="color:gold; font-size:200%">Sisters</p>
<p>Both of my sister's currently attend the University of Maine. Jessica, a senior at UMaine, is the oldest of the three of us, and I am the youngest. Jessica is going to school for veterinarian science and plans to become a veterinarian for a career. Christine is currently a junior at UMaine and is going to school for medical fields. She plans to work in the emergency room.</p></li>
