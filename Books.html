<p align="left"; style="color:gold; font-size:200%">Favorite Genres</p>
<p>Of all genres of literature, my favorite are Royal Fiction/Nonfiction, Horror, and Mythology (Mostly Greek, but I also enjoy reading about Egyptian, Roman, Norse, and other mythology).</p>
<p align="left"; style="color:gold; font-size:200%">Favorite Authors</p>
<p>My favorite authors are English historical novelist Philippa Gregory, and American author's Stephen King and Rick Riordan. Gregory has written many books and novels based on royal history in the United Kingdom. Many of King's own books are horror and supernatural/science fiction. As for Rick Riordan, he has written many modern day stories based off of ancient Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythologies. These books are known as the Percy Jackson series and the Magnus Chase series.</p></li>
